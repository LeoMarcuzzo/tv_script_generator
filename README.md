# TV-script Generator
TV-script generator using RNN - Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

Implemented using PyTorch

The original repo (Udacity) can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation)

The code is located in the Jupyter Notebook and the dataset can be found in the Udacity repo above


## Project Overview
Given a dataset of Seinfeld scripts to train, the RNN generates a new TV-script from a provided word.

RNN architecture:
- Embedding layer
- LSTM layer
- Linear layer (fully-connected)
